# RPS
This is a small paper, rock, scissors game I tried to construct in one of my studio classes at Kstate. It is nothing much because I did not have much opportunity to build onto it due to personal issues with school. However, the goal of my program was to have the game set up with a server so that it can be played across platforms. I learned a lot in the process of creating this program because I was able to familiarize myself with node.js to retrieve files and create a server of my own. It is a very helpful technique that I can use for future projects as I continue in my field and a lot of fun to do even though I am not that great of a programmer.
